This package will help you work with data from the Sp√∂reg mobile app. The package contains
functions to read (and do some cleanup) of data files exported from predefined queries in APEX (datastore).

I also contains rmarkdown templates for some reports. 
This package is probably not useful for the general public.

To install try remotes::install_github("SLU-Aqua-large-lakes/sporegr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
